## 🎮 What is this madness?

Ever wondered what would happen if a sound-blasting dog named Sheera took on an army of Linux mascots? No? Well, now you can find out anyway!

## 🤔 Why does this exist?

Why not? Sometimes the best ideas come from the most random combinations. Sheera needed a worthy opponent, and Tux volunteered as tribute.

- Shields reflect sound waves - use this to your advantage!
- The more you bark, the hotter Sheera gets (literally)
- Tux penguins split into smaller versions when hit - prioritize the small ones!
